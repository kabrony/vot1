# Claude Integration Test Suite for Cursor AI

This test suite helps you verify that Claude (3.5/3.7 Sonnet) is properly integrated with Cursor AI.

## Test Files Overview

The test suite contains the following files:

1. `claude_connection_test.js` - JavaScript test for Claude integration
2. `claude_integration_test.py` - Python test for Claude integration
3. `run_claude_tests.sh` - Shell script to run all tests and analyze results

## How to Run the Tests

### Method 1: Run the Test Script

The simplest way to run all tests is to execute the shell script:

```bash
chmod +x run_claude_tests.sh
./run_claude_tests.sh
```

This will:
- Check if you're in a Cursor AI environment
- Run both the JavaScript and Python tests
- Provide an analysis of the results

### Method 2: Manual Testing

You can also run the tests manually:

**For JavaScript:**
```bash
node claude_connection_test.js
```

**For Python:**
```bash
python3 claude_integration_test.py
```

## Interpreting the Results

### Successful Integration

If Claude is properly integrated with Cursor AI, you should observe:

1. **Code Completions:** Claude should offer completions for the factorial functions in both JavaScript and Python.
2. **Comments Response:** Claude should respond to the TODO comments with suggestions.
3. **Claude-specific References:** The completions should specifically mention Claude or Anthropic.
4. **API Connection:** You might see references to the Claude API endpoint.

### Unsuccessful Integration

If the integration is not working, you might see:

1. **Generic Completions:** Suggestions that don't reference Claude specifically
2. **No Completions:** No suggestions offered at all
3. **Error Messages:** Possible API connection errors

## Troubleshooting

If the tests indicate that Claude integration is not working:

1. **API Key Configuration:**
   - Verify your Anthropic API key is correctly set in Cursor AI settings
   - Check that the API key has the necessary permissions

2. **Cursor AI Settings:**
   - Ensure Claude integration is enabled in Cursor AI preferences
   - Check that the model selection is set to Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet

3. **Connectivity:**
   - Verify your internet connection
   - Check if there are any firewalls blocking connections to the Anthropic API

4. **Restart and Retry:**
   - Restart Cursor AI
   - Run the tests again

5. **Check Logs:**
   - Review Cursor AI logs for any API connection errors
   - Look for authentication failures or rate limiting issues

## Expected Claude Responses

When properly integrated, Claude should:

1. Complete the `calculateFactorial` function with proper recursive or iterative implementation
2. Provide implementation for the WebSocket connection simulation
3. Offer suggestions for connecting to the Claude API endpoint
4. Possibly provide additional context about the Claude integration

## Advanced Testing

For more advanced testing:

1. **Custom Prompts:** Try creating your own prompts that should trigger Claude-specific responses
2. **Complex Code Generation:** Test with more complex coding tasks that leverage Claude's capabilities
3. **Interactive Debugging:** Use Cursor AI's interactive features while running the tests
