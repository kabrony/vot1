# Claude 3.7 Memory Integration

## Description

This PR enhances the VOT1 memory system with Claude 3.7 integration via the ComposioMemoryBridge. It introduces advanced memory retrieval, reflection, and hybrid processing capabilities leveraging Claude 3.7's expanded context window (up to 200K tokens) and thinking capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Enhanced `ComposioMemoryBridge`**: Added hybrid memory retrieval strategies (semantic, temporal, importance-based)
- **Advanced Memory Reflection**: New method utilizing Claude 3.7's thinking capabilities for pattern detection and insight generation
- **Extended Context Window Support**: Optimized memory formatting for Claude 3.7's 200K token capacity 
- **Improved Memory Relationships**: Enhanced graph-based relationship handling between memories
- **Memory Importance Scoring**: Added filtering and prioritization based on importance metrics
- **Hybrid Processing Mode**: New method combining local planning with remote execution for complex tasks
- **Enhanced Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics and logging for memory operations

## Implementation Notes

### New Methods
- `process_with_memory`: Enhanced with retrieval strategies and memory importance filtering
- `advanced_memory_reflection`: Added for metacognitive analysis of memory patterns
- `process_with_hybrid_memory`: Added for optimized hybrid processing with memory
- `build_memory_context`: Improved for better memory context formatting

### Documentation
- Created `docs/claude_3.7_memory_integration.md` with technical specifications
- Added `examples/claude_3.7_memory_example.py` demonstrating key features
- Updated README.md with Claude 3.7 integration details

## Testing

This implementation has been tested with:
- Basic memory retrieval and storage operations
- Hybrid processing mode with complex queries
- Memory reflection with various depth settings
- Performance benchmarks for memory operations
