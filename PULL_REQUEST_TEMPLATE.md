# Claude 3.7 Memory Integration

## Description

This PR enhances the VOT1 memory system with Claude 3.7 integration via the ComposioMemoryBridge. It introduces advanced memory retrieval, reflection, and hybrid processing capabilities leveraging Claude 3.7's expanded context window and thinking capabilities.

## Key Features

- Enhanced `ComposioMemoryBridge` with hybrid memory retrieval strategies
- Advanced memory reflection using Claude 3.7's thinking capabilities
- Extended context window support (up to 200K tokens)
- Improved memory relationship handling and graph traversal
- Memory importance scoring and filtering
- Hybrid processing mode for optimized memory operations
- Enhanced performance tracking and comprehensive logging

## Implementation Notes

- Added new memory retrieval strategies (semantic, temporal, hybrid)
- Implemented advanced reflection with configurable depth options
- Enhanced memory context formatting for Claude 3.7
- Added relationship creation between memories, responses, and thinking
- Improved performance with detailed metrics tracking

## Documentation

- Added README for Composio integration
- Created technical specification for Claude 3.7 memory integration
- Updated docstrings with comprehensive implementation details

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- [ ] Basic memory retrieval and storage operations
- [ ] Hybrid processing mode with complex queries
- [ ] Memory reflection with various depth settings
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for memory operations

## Related Issues

Closes #XXX

## Additional Notes

This integration is designed to be backward compatible with existing code while providing enhanced capabilities for Claude 3.7 specifically.
