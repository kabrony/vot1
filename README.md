## üí´ About Us

VOT1 is being developed by a multidisciplinary team passionate about creating the next generation of self-improving AI systems. We're building technology that combines the best of symbolic reasoning and vector-based representations with the ability to enhance its own code.

Our mission is to create AI systems that can:
- **Think about themselves**: Analyze their own performance and architecture
- **Reason over memories**: Connect information using formal ontologies
- **Evolve autonomously**: Generate and validate their own improvements
- **Explain their thinking**: Make AI operations transparent and understandable

For a deeper dive into our philosophy, technical innovations, and roadmap, check out our [ABOUT.md](ABOUT.md) file.

VOT1 is being developed by a multidisciplinary team passionate about creating the next generation of self-improving AI systems. We're building technology that combines the best of symbolic reasoning and vector-based representations with the ability to enhance its own code.

Our mission is to create AI systems that can:
- **Think about themselves**: Analyze their own performance and architecture
- **Reason over memories**: Connect information using formal ontologies
- **Evolve autonomously**: Generate and validate their own improvements
- **Explain their thinking**: Make AI operations transparent and understandable

## Key Features

- **Vector-based Memory Management**: Store and retrieve memories using vector embeddings for semantic similarity search with advanced clustering and contextual retrieval
- **OWL Reasoning Engine**: Apply ontology-based reasoning to memories and system components, enabling formal inference and inconsistency detection
- **Self-Improvement Workflows**: Automated analysis, code generation, and validation cycles that enhance system components without human intervention
- **THREE.js Dashboard**: Interactive 3D visualization of memory connections with cyberpunk aesthetic, providing an immersive way to explore the system's "mind"
