2. **Self-Improvement Workflow (`src/vot1/self_improvement_workflow.py`)**
   - Fully refactored to use Claude 3.7 Sonnet
   - Implements enhanced memory capabilities
   - Provides improved GitHub integration

3. **Repository Management (`scripts/update_and_push.py`)**
   - New script for automated repository management
   - Handles code formatting, testing, and pushing to GitHub
   - Provides detailed logging and error handling

4. **Memory Benchmarking (`src/vot1/composio/memory_benchmark.py`)**
   - Enhanced memory benchmarking capabilities
   - Tests various memory operations and provides performance metrics
   - Supports hybrid thinking capabilities testing

## Using the Improved System

### Running the Self-Improvement Workflow

```bash
# Run the complete self-improvement workflow
python -m src.vot1.self_improvement_workflow

# With specific options
python -m src.vot1.self_improvement_workflow --thinking-tokens 10000 --github-token YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Running the Repository Update Tool

```bash
# Run the repository update tool
python scripts/update_and_push.py

# With specific options
python scripts/update_and_push.py --branch feature/my-improvements --no-tests
```

### Running Memory Benchmarks

```bash
# Run memory benchmarks
python scripts/run_memory_benchmark.py

# With visualization
python scripts/run_memory_benchmark.py --generate-report
```

## Future Roadmap

### Short-term Goals (1-2 Months)

1. **Extended Agent Network**
   - Implement agent-to-agent communication
   - Add role-based agent specializations
   - Create agent collaboration patterns

2. **IPFS Integration**
   - Add IPFS-based persistent storage
   - Implement distributed memory sharing
   - Create content-addressed memory indexing

3. **Supabase Integration**
   - Implement structured data storage
   - Add real-time data synchronization
   - Create relationship mapping capabilities

### Medium-term Goals (3-6 Months)

1. **24/7 Autonomous Operation**
   - Implement continuous operation capabilities
   - Add health monitoring and auto-recovery
   - Create balanced resource utilization

2. **Extended Tool Ecosystem**

### Long-term Vision

The long-term vision for VOTai is to create a fully autonomous agent ecosystem that can operate continuously, learning and improving itself while providing valuable services. This includes:

1. **Autonomous Learning**: Agents that learn from their interactions and improve over time
2. **Decentralized Operation**: Distributed operation across multiple nodes without central coordination
3. **Ecosystem Collaboration**: Agents that collaborate across organizational boundaries
4. **Self-Optimization**: Continuous system optimization without human intervention
