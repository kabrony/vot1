## Key Concepts

### Machine Capability Providers (MCPs)

The VOT1 Dashboard integrates external capabilities through Machine Capability Providers:

- **Perplexity AI**: Web research and information retrieval
- **Firecrawl**: Web crawling and content extraction
- **Claude 3.7**: Advanced reasoning and code analysis

### Hybrid Thinking

The dashboard implements a hybrid thinking approach that combines:

1. **Extended Thinking**: Claude 3.7's internal reasoning process (up to 60,000 tokens)
2. **Real-time Research**: Perplexity AI's web research capabilities
3. **Persistent Memory**: Storage and retrieval of project knowledge
4. **Integration Layer**: Orchestration of the above components

### Development Assistant

The Development Assistant enhances coding workflows through:

- **Code Analysis**: Deep understanding of code structure and patterns
- **Research-Driven Development**: Using latest best practices and documentation
- **Script Generation**: Creating utility scripts, tests, and documentation
- **Troubleshooting**: Identifying and fixing code issues efficiently

## Interface Overview

The VOT1 Dashboard features a cyberpunk-inspired interface with:

- **Cyberpunk Chat**: High-contrast, neon-accented chat interface
- **Command System**: Slash commands for specialized operations
- **Thinking Visualization**: Visual representation of Claude's reasoning
- **Status Indicators**: Connection status for integrated services
- **Research Display**: Formatted presentation of research findings with citations
