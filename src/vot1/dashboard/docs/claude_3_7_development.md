// Ask Claude to analyze this function
function calculateTotalPrice(items, discountCode, userTier) {
  let subtotal = 0;
  for (const item of items) {
    subtotal += item.price * item.quantity;
  }
  
  let discount = 0;
  if (discountCode === 'SUMMER10') {
    discount = subtotal * 0.1;
  } else if (discountCode === 'SUPER20') {
    discount = subtotal * 0.2;
  }
  
  if (userTier === 'premium') {
    discount += subtotal * 0.05;
  }

    this.state = {
      user: null,
      orders: [],
      loading: true,
      error: null,
    };
  }
  
  componentDidMount() {
    this.fetchUserData();
    this.fetchOrders();
  }
  
  fetchUserData() {
    api.getUser()
      .then(user => this.setState({ user }))
      .catch(error => this.setState({ error }))
      .finally(() => this.setState({ loading: false }));
  }
  
  fetchOrders() {
    api.getOrders()
      .then(orders => this.setState({ orders }))
      .catch(error => this.setState({ error }));
  }
  
  render() {
    if (this.state.loading) return <LoadingSpinner />;
    if (this.state.error) return <ErrorMessage error={this.state.error} />;
    
    return (
      <div className="dashboard">
        <UserProfile user={this.state.user} />
        <OrderHistory orders={this.state.orders} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Thinking Visualization Examples

### Problem Analysis Thinking

```html
<div class="thinking-node">
  <div class="node-header">Problem Analysis</div>
  <div class="node-content">
    <p>The user is asking about a memory leak in their React application. From the description, this appears to be related to event listeners not being properly cleaned up in useEffect hooks.</p>
    
    <p>I need to consider:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Common patterns for useEffect cleanup</li>
      <li>How event listeners are being attached</li>
      <li>Component lifecycle interactions</li>
      <li>Tools for identifying memory leaks in React</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Solution Exploration Thinking

```html
<div class="thinking-node">
  <div class="node-header">Solution Exploration</div>
  <div class="node-content">
    <p>I'll consider three approaches to solve this memory leak:</p>
    
    <h4>Approach 1: Proper useEffect Cleanup</h4>
    <p>Ensure all event listeners have corresponding cleanup functions in useEffect returns. This addresses the root cause but requires identifying all problematic effects.</p>
    
    <h4>Approach 2: Centralized Event Management</h4>
    <p>Implement a centralized event management system that tracks all listeners and automatically cleans them up when components unmount. This is more architectural but provides a systematic solution.</p>
    
    <h4>Approach 3: Use React's Built-in Event System</h4>
    <p>Where possible, use React's synthetic event system rather than direct DOM event listeners, as React handles cleanup automatically. This won't work for window/document events but is cleaner for component events.</p>
    
    <p>Given the description of the problem, Approach 1 seems most appropriate as a starting point, potentially followed by Approach 2 for a more robust long-term solution.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Implementation Planning Thinking

```html
<div class="thinking-node">
  <div class="node-header">Implementation Planning</div>
  <div class="node-content">
    <p>To implement the proper useEffect cleanup approach, I'll walk through these steps:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Identify problematic components:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Look for useEffect hooks that add event listeners</li>
          <li>Check for missing return cleanup functions</li>
          <li>Focus on components that mount/unmount frequently</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add cleanup functions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Implement proper removeEventListener in return functions</li>
          <li>Ensure event parameters match exactly between add/remove</li>
          <li>Use the same function reference for both adding and removing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Verify fixes:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Use React DevTools Profiler to monitor component render behavior</li>
          <li>Use Chrome DevTools Memory tab to check for leaked DOM nodes</li>
          <li>Test mounting/unmounting scenarios extensively</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>I'll begin by examining the EventManager component the user mentioned, as it's likely the source of the issue.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
