Extended thinking refers to Claude 3.7's ability to use significantly more tokens (up to 60,000) for its internal reasoning process. This enables:

- **Deep Analysis**: Thoroughly examining complex codebases
- **Multiple Approaches**: Considering several solution strategies in parallel
- **Self-Criticism**: Evaluating and refining its own reasoning
- **Detailed Planning**: Creating comprehensive implementation plans before coding

The dashboard visualizes this extended thinking, making the AI's reasoning process transparent and accessible.

### Real-Time Research

Perplexity AI integration enables the system to:

- **Access Current Information**: Retrieve up-to-date data from the web
- **Verify Facts**: Cross-check information against reliable sources
- **Find Relevant Documentation**: Locate API docs, tutorials, and examples
- **Explore Best Practices**: Research current industry standards

This real-time research capability ensures the system can provide accurate, current advice even on rapidly evolving technologies.

### Persistent Memory

The memory subsystem allows the system to:

- **Store Insights**: Save important discoveries about the codebase
- **Track Project Context**: Maintain awareness of project goals and constraints
- **Remember Past Solutions**: Apply previously successful approaches to new problems
- **Build Knowledge Over Time**: Accumulate domain-specific understanding

This persistence creates a continuously improving assistant that becomes more valuable over time.

</div>
```

## Token Management

The Hybrid Thinking System carefully manages token usage across components:

### Token Allocation

- **Thinking Process**: Up to 60,000 tokens
- **Research Queries**: Typically 300-500 tokens per query
- **Research Results**: Up to 4,000 tokens for important topics
- **Memory Access**: 500-1,000 tokens for relevant memories
- **User Context**: Varies based on code complexity (5,000-20,000 tokens)
- **Response Generation**: 1,000-5,000 tokens

### Optimization Strategies

The system employs several strategies to optimize token usage:

1. **Dynamic Allocation**:
   - Allocates tokens based on query complexity
   - Prioritizes tokens for the most critical reasoning components
   - Adjusts allocation based on available context window

2. **Progressive Loading**:
   - Starts with essential context
   - Loads additional context as needed
   - Discards irrelevant context to free up tokens

3. **Compression Techniques**:
   - Summarizes large code files
   - Extracts key patterns rather than including all examples
   - Focuses on critical sections of documentation

4. **Memory Filtering**:
   - Retrieves only the most relevant memories
   - Prioritizes recent and frequently accessed memories
   - Summarizes memory content when full detail isn't needed

## Research Integration

The system integrates Perplexity research into the thinking process through several mechanisms:

### Query Formulation

- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies information needs during reasoning
- **Query Refinement**: Crafts precise queries to retrieve relevant information
- **Iterative Research**: Follows up with more specific queries based on initial results

### Source Evaluation

- **Credibility Assessment**: Evaluates source reliability and recency
- **Consensus Finding**: Looks for agreement across multiple sources
- **Contradiction Resolution**: Addresses conflicting information

### Knowledge Integration

- **Contextual Placement**: Inserts research at relevant points in reasoning
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluates how new information affects current thinking
- **Hypothesis Revision**: Updates approaches based on research findings

## Memory Management

The persistent memory system organizes information into several categories:

### Memory Categories

1. **Project Knowledge**
   - Architecture and structure
   - Design patterns used
   - Dependencies and their purposes
   - Custom conventions and practices

2. **Technical Solutions**
   - Previous code implementations
   - Problem-solving approaches
   - Performance optimizations
   - Bug fixes and their rationales

3. **User Preferences**
   - Preferred coding styles
   - Commonly requested features
   - Recurring questions
   - Communication preferences

4. **External Resources**
   - Useful documentation links
   - Relevant tutorials
   - Similar projects
   - Community discussions

### Memory Operations

The memory subsystem supports these core operations:

1. **Store**: Save new information with metadata
   ```javascript
   memory.store({
     category: 'Project Knowledge',
     key: 'authentication-flow',
     data: {
       description: 'The application uses JWT for authentication with token refresh.',
       components: ['LoginService', 'AuthInterceptor', 'UserStore'],
       flow: ['Login', 'Store Token', 'Attach to Requests', 'Refresh if Needed']
     },
     metadata: {
       created: Date.now(),
       importance: 'high',
       confidence: 0.95
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Retrieve**: Get information by category and key
   ```javascript
   const authInfo = memory.retrieve('Project Knowledge', 'authentication-flow');
   ```

3. **Search**: Find relevant information across categories
   ```javascript
   const results = memory.search('authentication JWT token');
   ```

4. **Update**: Modify existing memory entries
   ```javascript
   memory.update('Project Knowledge', 'authentication-flow', {
     data: { 
       // Updated data
     },
     metadata: {
       updated: Date.now(),
       updates: ['Added refresh token handling details']
     }
   });
   ```

5. **List**: Enumerate available memory entries
   ```javascript
   const projectKnowledge = memory.list('Project Knowledge');
   ```

6. **Delete**: Remove obsolete information
   ```javascript
   memory.delete('Project Knowledge', 'outdated-feature');
   ```

### Memory Lifecycle

Memory entries follow a lifecycle:

1. **Creation**: Initial storage of information
2. **Reinforcement**: Repeated access strengthens importance
3. **Enrichment**: Adding additional context and details
4. **Revision**: Updating with new information
5. **Archival**: Moving to long-term storage when less frequently accessed
6. **Deletion**: Removing obsolete information
