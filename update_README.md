# Improved Claude Integration Test Suite

This improved test suite provides multiple methods to verify that Claude 3.7 Sonnet is properly integrated with Cursor AI.

## Why These New Tests?

The previous tests ran successfully but didn't provide clear evidence of Claude integration. These new tests are:

1. More direct - Explicitly asking Claude to respond
2. Simpler - Reduced complexity for easier verification 
3. More interactive - Providing visual feedback

## New Test Files

### 1. Direct Test Files
- `claude_direct_test.js` - JavaScript file with direct prompts to Claude
- `claude_simple_test.py` - Minimal Python test for Claude integration

### 2. Configuration Guide
- `claude_integration_setup.md` - Detailed guide for properly configuring Claude with Cursor AI

### 3. Interactive Test
- `interactive_claude_test.html` - HTML-based interactive test for visual verification

## How to Test Claude Integration

### Method 1: Direct Tests in Cursor

1. Open `claude_simple_test.py` or `claude_direct_test.js` in Cursor AI
2. Wait for Claude completions to appear (should happen automatically)
3. If you see:
   - Function implementations for factorial/fibonacci
   - Comments mentioning Claude specifically
   - Responses to the direct prompts
   
   Then Claude is properly integrated!

### Method 2: Check Configuration

1. Review the `claude_integration_setup.md` file
2. Follow the steps to verify your Cursor AI settings
3. Make any necessary configuration changes

### Method 3: Interactive Testing

1. Open `interactive_claude_test.html` in a browser (within Cursor AI)
2. Run the tests and follow the instructions
3. Analyze the results to verify integration

## Common Issues and Solutions

If Claude integration isn't working:

1. **API Key Issues**
   - Ensure your Anthropic API key is correct
   - Check if your key has Claude 3.7 Sonnet access

2. **Cursor Configuration**
   - Verify Claude is selected as your AI provider
   - Make sure there are no competing AI providers enabled

3. **Connection Problems**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify that your network allows API connections to Anthropic

4. **Activation**
   - Restart Cursor AI after configuration
   - Try triggering Claude with Ctrl+K or Cmd+K and specific prompts

## Next Steps

Once you've verified Claude integration:

1. Try using Claude for real coding tasks
2. Experiment with different prompt styles
3. Test Claude's capabilities with complex coding challenges
